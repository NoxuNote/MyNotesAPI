# MyNotesAPI
The public notes 'crud' REST API.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project and uses the [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) library as an interpreter for OpenAPI3 specification.<br>
Furthermore, it uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as ORM to facilitate PostgreSQL write operations.<br>
The project is a part of the <b>NotesCloud</b> repository which gives a full Dockerized environment which includes the authentication proxy.

## Authentication
Authentication is assumed to be done by a reverse-prooxy that replaces an authorization token in cookie emited by the user with a <b>X-OAPI-User-Id</b> header which is a proof that the user is authenticated.
<br><br>
The <b>X-OAPI-User-Id</b> header contains the user UUID.
